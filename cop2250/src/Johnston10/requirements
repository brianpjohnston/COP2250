Exercise 2
Three files are required as below.
Design and save your Motor class before you make Vehicle, so you can specify Motor as a Vehicle data attribute.

Class Motor
Attributes (all private)

int cylinders
int hp
String type (values gas, deisel, electric etc)
Methods (public)

a constructor that can assign values to all attributes
getters for each attribute (setters not needed)
a toString method that returns the status of a Motor instance, all attributes.
Class Vehicle
Attributes (all private)

String make
String model
int year
double price
Motor motor (see below)
Methods (public)

a constructor that can assign values to all attributes
a setter for the price
a getter for the price
a toString method that returns the status of a Vehicle instance, all attributes.
Class TestVehicle
This is the executable class. Use only main.
In the main method, make two or three Vehicle instances, then display their status.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (yours can vary but should show all attribute values)

2015 Tesla Model S P85D, price=105000.0
Motor: cylinders=0, hp=503, type=Electric

2015 Dodge Challenger Hellcat, price=62000.0
Motor: cylinders=8, hp=707, type=Gas

Recheck the requirements before you submit.
