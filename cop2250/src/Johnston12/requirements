Create a new Java Project in your Eclipse workspace named as before, smith12 or jones12 for example.
Create a package with the very same name as your project name.
In this one package, write one Java program for each exercise as required below.
Adhere to naming conventions for variables and classes as in section 2.8.
Choose descriptive variable names and identifiers in all programs.
Start each program with your name and SPC ID# in a comment.
Add a few more comments in each program to explain what your code is doing.
When all programs are done, locate your project folder in your workspace.
Right-click on the project folder folder (don't open it!) and select "Send to" --> "Compressed (zipped) folder". This will make a zip with the same name as your project.
Upload the zip to this drop box. Type your collaboration statement into the message area of the drop box.
Submit your assignment.
Chapter 12 Programming Exercises: 12.3 and 12.5.

Exercise 1
Create a Java program with a method that searches an integer array for a specified integer value. If the array contains
 the specified integer, the method should return its index in the array. If not, the method should throw an Exception
 stating "Element not found in array" and end gracefully. Test the method in main.

Exercise 2
Write a program that generates 10 random doubles, all between 1 and 11, and writes them to a text file, one number per line. Then write another program that reads the text file and displays all the doubles and their sum accurate to decimal places.
